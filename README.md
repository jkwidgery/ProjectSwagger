# ProjectSwagger
C++ snippets from my work on Project Swagger, a game jam indie game built in Unreal Engine 5. Link to play: https://baldsavant.itch.io/project-swagger

This 8-week project was created as an opportunity for a group of recently-laid-off game devs to learn Unreal Engine. 

As the Engineering Lead, my responsibilites included:

- Identify and delegate engineering tasks to team of 5 engineers
- Liason with other disciplines to ensure design needs were met
- Design and implement various gameplay systems in C++ and Blueprints
- Implement audio using Wwise Audio Integration
- Debug and resolve issues in Unreal Engine
